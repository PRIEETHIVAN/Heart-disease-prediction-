## 🚀 Project Overview

This project is an end-to-end **Machine Learning web application** that predicts the likelihood of heart disease based on clinical health parameters.

It demonstrates the complete ML workflow:

- Data preprocessing  
- Exploratory Data Analysis  
- Model training & evaluation  
- Model comparison  
- Model serialization  
- Web integration using Flask  
- Deployment-ready configuration  

The application allows users to enter medical attributes and receive an instant prediction through a web interface.

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Heart disease is one of the leading causes of mortality globally. Early prediction using data-driven models can assist healthcare professionals in preventive diagnosis and timely treatment.

This project builds a **binary classification model** to predict:

- `1` → Heart Disease Present  
- `0` → No Heart Disease  

---

## 📊 Dataset Information

The dataset contains structured medical records with features such as:

- Age  
- Sex  
- Chest Pain Type  
- Resting Blood Pressure  
- Cholesterol  
- Fasting Blood Sugar  
- Resting ECG  
- Maximum Heart Rate  
- Exercise-Induced Angina  
- ST Depression  
- Slope  
- Number of Major Vessels  
- Thalassemia  

The target variable indicates the presence of heart disease.
